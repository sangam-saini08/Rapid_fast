ðŸš€ FastAPI Microblogging API  This is a lightweight and fast REST API built with FastAPI that provides basic features of a microblogging platform, similar to Twitter. Users can sign up, log in, and post short messages ("tweets"). It uses modern Python standards with type hints, Pydantic for data validation, and SQLModel for database interaction.
